  CuriosityDescription: Webbs Telescope uses infrared light, which cannot be perceived
    by the human eye, to study every phase in cosmic history. The telescope's four
    scientific instruments are specifically designed to capture infrared light, and
    are able to peer through cosmic dust to study colder or very distant objects.
