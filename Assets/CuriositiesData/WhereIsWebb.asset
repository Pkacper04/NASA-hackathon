  CuriosityDescription: In addition to orbiting the Sun, Webb makes a tight orbit
    around a point in space known as Lagrange 2, or L2. This point is located 1.5
    million kilometres from Earth. Its distant location gives Webb an unobstructed
    view of the sky, and aids its ability to see much farther into the universe than
    the Hubble Space Telescope.
